# Java-shopping-application
This is a personal project which aims to teach me:

GitHub
JDBC & MySQL
Further exposure to Java

The idea of this project is that the final result will be a simple shopping system where a user can add products or customers depending on who the user is and then place orders which will depend simple factors like stock - all of this information which is stored within a local MySQL database. The Schema for this database is on this repo so it can be easily replicated by anyone else wanting to learn similar things.

Please note that the project was more focused on the Java side of things and therefore the database is in no means the most efficient and effective.
