# Java-shopping-application
This is a personal project which aims to teach me:

GitHub, JDBC, MySQL & Further exposure to Java

The idea of this project is that the final result will be a simple shopping system where a user can add products or customers depending on who the user is and then place orders which will depend simple factors like stock - all of this information which is stored within a local MySQL database. The Schema for this database is on this repo so it can be easily replicated by anyone else wanting to learn similar things.

Please note that the project was more focused on the Java side of things and therefore the database is in no means the most efficient and effective.

- DEVELOPMENT HAS STOPPED - 

I got to the 2 week mark after doing an hour or two a day and realised that when implementing new features or making bug fixes I wasn't learning anything new as everything is basically a slight re-implementation of something I have already done. The aim of this project was to simply learn how to build a simple user interface, create basic database connections and to use git for the first time, all of these goals have been more than achieved and I don't think refactoring code or implementing features/bug fixes would push me any further. The code is not to a great standard but I am fine with that.

Time to move onto something a little different.
